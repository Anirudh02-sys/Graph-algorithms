# Graph_algorithms

Solutions for some very interseting and importent graph problems.

#Graphs 
Data structure used - Adjacency matrix (Except for Topological sorting)
1. Comparision of minimum spanning tree algorithms (PRIMS and KRUSKALS)
2. Graph Travesersal Algorithms - Breadth first search(BFS) and Depth first search(DFS)
3. DFS Solution to Maxflow problem
4. Shortest Path algorthims - Dijkstras , Bellman ford for SSSP problem
                              Floyd-Warshall Algorithm for All pair shortest path problem


#Data_structures_implemented(ADDITIONAL)
1. AVL tree - Along with Bst , for comparision 
2. Binary heap - A very easy and small implementation for binomial heap
